# APNG support project evaluation
## Research phase
Learned a lot about the inner workings of the PNG/APNG formats and how graphics formats are imported/exported within LibreOffice

## APNG parsing
Implemented APNG parsing, which includes reading the chunks, separating the different data sections for each frame, and using their frame specific options, creating a
Graphic object.

## APNG exporting
Added support for exporting a Graphic object into an APNG, in a way that other animated objects such as ones imported from GIFs (or other formats in the future perhaps) can be seamlessly converted to APNGs

## Work done
Full APNG import support as an animated graphic
Full APNG export support
Can export APNGs from the UI
APNG related unit tests

## Final thoughts
Google Summer of Code was a great experience and a great learning opportunity and LibreOffice was an amazing organization with very knowledgable mentors. I suggest it to anyone wishing to join GSoC in the future!
